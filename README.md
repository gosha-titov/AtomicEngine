# Description

`AtomicEngine` finds typos by comparing user text with the accurate one.
It creates a math model based on the given texts and then applies many complicated algorithms to it.
The initial accuracy is 100%, but the longer the text â€“ the more difficult the calculations are and therefore the longer the execution time.
So you can limit the comparison area, thereby increasing the speed, but reducing the accuracy.
This is absolutely not critical for phrases of 2-3 words, but for large texts there may be sometimes inaccuracy.
